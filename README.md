# 📦 Order Splitting Logic

One of the important features of this project is **Order Splitting**.

If a customer purchases products from multiple vendors, the system automatically creates **separate orders** for each vendor.

### Example

```
Customer Cart

Mouse ---------- Vendor A
Keyboard ------- Vendor A
Headphones ----- Vendor B
```

After Checkout

```
Order #101
Vendor A

• Mouse
• Keyboard

---------------------

Order #102
Vendor B

• Headphones
```

### Benefits

- Vendors see only their own orders.
- Easier order management.
- Independent shipping.
- Separate vendor analytics.
- Better scalability.
